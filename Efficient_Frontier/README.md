The efficient frontier is a key concept in modern portfolio theory (MPT), introduced by Harry Markowitz in 1952. It represents the set of optimal portfolios that offer the highest expected return for a given level of risk (standard deviation) or the lowest risk for a given level of return.

### Key Concepts:
Risk & Return: Each portfolio has an expected return and a risk level (measured by standard deviation).

Diversification: Combining assets reduces overall risk through diversification.

Dominance: Portfolios below the efficient frontier are suboptimal because higher returns could be achieved for the same or lower risk.

### Efficient Frontier Construction Steps:
Estimate Expected Returns and standard deviations for all assets.

Calculate Covariances between assets to understand diversification benefits.

Optimize Portfolios by solving for the highest return at each risk level.

Plot the Efficient Frontier, which forms a curve in risk-return space.

Key Features:
The minimum-variance portfolio (MVP) is the portfolio with the lowest possible risk.

The tangency portfolio maximizes the Sharpe ratio when a risk-free asset is introduced.

Investors choose points on the efficient frontier based on risk tolerance.
