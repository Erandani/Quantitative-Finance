Monte Carlo Simulation for Stock Price Prediction
Monte Carlo Simulation is a statistical technique used to model the probability of different outcomes in a process that involves randomness. For stock price prediction, we use the Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) model, which assumes that stock prices follow a random walk with drift.

Monte Carlo Simulation Steps
Fetch historical stock price data using Yahoo Finance.

Estimate key parameters: drift (expected return) and volatility (standard deviation of returns).
